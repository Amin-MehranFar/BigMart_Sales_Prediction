# BigMart Sales Prediction- Regression Project

In the following regression project, a dataset of more than 14,000 BigMart sales records has been analyzed and modelled, applying diverse regression models to forecast product sales at individual stores.

We will explore the problem in following stages:

* Data Exploration – looking at categorical and continuous feature summaries and making inferences about the data.
* Data Cleaning – imputing missing values in the data and checking for outliers
* Feature Engineering – modifying existing variables and creating new ones for analysis
* Model Building – making predictive models on the data
